Cook the pasta as per the pack instructions. Ideally it should be cooked in 2 litres of water with 2 tbsp of salt added (don't worry, most of it will go down the sink!).

Once cooked drain and make sure to keep the drained pasta water.

Rinse the pasta to stop it sticking and set aside.

Peel the sweet potatoes and cut into bite sized pieces and boil until soft.

Once cooked drain and rinse the sweet potatoes.

In a blender or food processor add the cooked sweet potatoes along with the pasta water, oil, nutritional yeast, garlic and salt and blend till smooth.

Put a non stick pan on high heat and add 1 tbsp of oil along with the cooked pasta. Add the sauce and bring up to temperature. If that sauce is becoming too dry due to heating add a little more pasta water until you reach the desired texture.

Taste and adjust the seasoning by adding more salt or pepper.

Cut the grilled courgette into bite size pieces and add before serving/ alternatively add the thawed peas
